# PulseOximeter-DigitalFilter
Implementing Digital Filters on C using Fixed-point arithmetic to reserve computational resources and improve execution time.

This project, a significant undertaking for my Masters program, involved the design and implementation of a digital filter using the C programming language. 
Initially, I implemented the filter using a floating-point algorithm to verify its functionality. 
Once the filter's effectiveness was confirmed, I further optimized the implementation using a fixed-point algorithm. 
This dual approach ensured that the filter achieved the same precise results while utilizing fewer computational resources and reducing overall computational time.
